## Intro
This project was created as a learning tool, as I am just a novice android programmer.
Over time I plan to add new features to it, as well as work on the design and feeling of the application itself.

MusicPlay is an offline music player app that searches for audio tracks on your phone and allows you to play them.

App uses an audio visualizer provided by [gauravk95](https://github.com/gauravk95), which you can check out [here](https://github.com/gauravk95/audio-visualizer-android).
